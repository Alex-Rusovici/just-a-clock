<h1>This is a basic website the has basic functionality</h1>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>The main purpose of this project is to create a more complex website, than a basic landing page. To have different components that have to interact with each other, to create a bare bones art style and, none the less, to further develop my skills in using javaScript</p>

</br>

<h2>Technologies</h2>
<p>For adding information I used basic HTML</p>

<p>For styling I used SCSS with basic modules imported for a cleaner process of altering the art direction</p>

<p>For functionality there is basic javaScript and other javaScript libraries for different purposes, like the animated background</p>
